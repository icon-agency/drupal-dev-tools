## Enabling this project

```
{
    "require": {
        "iconagency/drupal-devtools"
    },
    ...
    "extra": {
        "drupal-scaffold": {
            "allowed-packages": [
                "iconagency/drupal-devtools"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Pre-commit checks

The idea behind is to put effort in to fail on simple checks as quickly as possible, and pre-commit hooks can be used to detect failures before they are even committed.

Pre-commit checks run after staging changes and running `git commit` and before a commit is completed. If the checks fail then the commit is not made and an error shown, while if all checks pass the commit is made as normal.

The aim is to run linting scripts and tests, allowing each commit to be as clean as possible.

### Ignore pre-commit hooks

For committing without any validation use the `--no-verify` flag.

## Scripts

**Note:** All linter scripts will run as part of the pre-commit checks. Setup can be found in `.lintstagedrc.yml` file.
